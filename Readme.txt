Hello, 

Bootstrap ready one page theme is adapted for wordpress. Additions have been made to the function file to provide page layouts without plugins. It is a simple theme. You can add to the projects section from the text adding section, and you can add any other additions from the "Theme Options" tab.

thanks..
